# Generic-Library
Generic Library inspired by STL in C++.
Language used:-C programming
Key Features:- It includes  Data Structure like SinglyLinkedList,DoublyLinkedList,Stack,Queue,Priority_queue,AVL Tree.
It is useful for a user who are working on C project.
In C++,With the help of STL we can use all the data structure directly but in C we need to write code from scratch.
But including this Generic Library We don't need to write code from scratch.
For example if we want to use Stack then simply include stack.h header file like stdio.h .
